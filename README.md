# Debugging Arena

* Welcome to the debugging side project created to learn the most important skill: debugging (for now, it only supports React.js).
* We will give you bugged code that you have to fix. The user can also select the level (easy, medium, hard).
* There is no time limit; you can take your time.

## Installation

* Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/Sujal-Rana-88/debugging-arena.git`.
* Now use `cd frontend` to go to the frontend folder and run `npm i` to install Node packages.
* Use `cd ..` to come back to the base directory, and then `cd backend` to go to the backend folder and run `npm i` to install Node packages.
* Make sure inside the backend folder you have created a `.env` file in which you must store: `GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_TOKEN_HERE`.
